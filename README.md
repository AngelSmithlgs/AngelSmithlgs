 About me: _I recently transitioned from a background in digital marketing to pursue a career in development. While I have a strong interest in backend work, I find my skills are particularly well-suited for frontend development. Exploring the full-stack path appeals to me, given the diverse opportunities it offers._

 _You'll quickly discover my passion for both cats and coffee (and videogames!). If you share these interests, we could have some delightful conversations about them! :P_
